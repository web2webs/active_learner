## Introduction

This library propose python classes to implement some of active learning techniques. Until now I made classes to implement two famous techniques: Uncertainty sampling and Query by committee. 

For those who don't know, active learning aims to reduce the number of experiences to train machine learning models. In brief, reach the max Accuracy of predicton with the minimum training set.


## Theoretical framework 

### 1. Uncertainty sampling:
